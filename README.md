HSON
====

HSON is a quick to use Android library which converts a json file from a network response to a JSON object with UTF-8 encoding as standard, ensuring that all those special characters are present in the JSON object.

HSON greatly simplifies the process as HSON handles all the networking, the conversion of the network response to a string and the conversion of the string to a UTF-8 encoded JSON object. The library uses the HttpUrlConnection class to ensure maximal compatibility.

HSON also provides a conversion class which converts any json string to a UTF-8 encoded JSON object.

The minimum API required for this library is API 3.

Dependencies
------------
To use the library, add the dependency to your app module's build.grade file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    
    // Add this dependency.
    compile 'uk.co.hassie:hson:0.0.2'
}
```

HSON Downloader example
-----------------------
```java
new HSON.Downloader()
    .setURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hassie-dash/hson/master/sample_json.json")
    .download(new Callback.DownloadCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onStart() {
            // Do any work required before the download is started ie. showing a progress dialog.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFinish(JSONObject json) {
            // JSON download successful. Do work with JSON here.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFail() {
            // JSON download failed. Handle error here if required.
        }
    });
```

Note: All callback methods must be overidden but can be left blank.

HSON Converter example
----------------------
```java
String jsonString = "some JSON string";

new HSON.Converter()
    .setString(jsonString)
    .convert(new Callback.ConversionCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onStart() {
            // Do any work required before the conversion is started ie. showing a progress dialog.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFinish(JSONObject json) {
            // JSON conversion successful. Do work with JSON here.
        }
        @Override
        public void onFail() {
            // JSON conversion failed. Handle error here if required.
        }
    });
```

Note: All callback methods must be overidden but can be left blank.
